# Design Compiler logic synthesis script
################################################################################
#
# This script is meant to be executed with the following directory structure
#
# project_top_folder
# |
# |- db: store output data like mapped designs or physical files like GDSII
# |
# |- phy: physical synthesis material (scripts, pins, etc)
# |
# |- rtl: contains rtl code for the design, it should also contain a
# |       hierarchy.txt file with the all the files that compose the design
# |
# |- syn: logic synthesis material (this script, SDC constraints, etc)
# |
# |- sim: simulation stuff like waveforms, reports, coverage etc.
# |
# |- tb: testbenches for the rtl code
# |
# |- exe: the directory where it should be executed. This keeps all the temp files
#         created by DC in that directory
#
#
# The standard way of executing the is from the project_top_folder
# with the following command
#
# $ dc_shell -f ../syn/dc_flat.tcl
#
# Additionally it should be possible to do
#
# $ make syn
#
# If the standard Makefile is present in the project directory
# Please check if you have the right constraints in ./syn/constraints.sdc
# Additionaly, please make sure that you have replaced SRAM_model with SRAM Macro
